Designed and built from scratch as my first major project on my path to becoming a software developer. This website was a means to build and display the skills I am learning and projects I have completed on my way to becoming a full-stack developer.

This website was designed in Figma and built using HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JS. I had originally hosted it through Github Pages but have since migrated it to use Netlify hosting.

The website can be viewed live here: https://clark-oake.netlify.app/
